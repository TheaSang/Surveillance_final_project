    <p id="introcontent">say something in general about our project <br> just three or four sentences, very brief <br> and it will look like this
        The issue of surveillance in the United States<br>
        Non-transparency, and abundance<br>
        Introduce Atlas of Surveillance (AoS) <br>  – an opensource research on the archival of police technologies in jurisdictions throughout the USA
        Follow up on the dataframe<br>  – its strengths and limitations.<br>
        It is not the exact number of technologies, but rather a collection of which the most pervasive digital surveillance technologies were introduced.
        It bases it’s findings on published articles that report on the deployment of these technologies.<br>
        How we will use AoS (and EFF)<br>
        Used to identify the most prevalent technologies introduced, and their vendors amongst which jurisdictions.<br>
        We aimed to humanize the data by zooming into the data and doing personal investigation, specifically on the technologies and their vendors.
        Limitations of data and future research<br>
